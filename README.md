Title: DequeImplementation - Double-ended Queue Implementation in C++

Description:
DequeImplementation is a C++ repository that provides an efficient implementation of a double-ended queue, also known as a deque. This repository demonstrates the use of various data structures and algorithms to support essential deque operations, offering a versatile and dynamic solution for managing elements at both ends of the queue.

Key Features:
- Double-ended Queue Functionality: DequeImplementation supports all the key operations of a double-ended queue, including inserting elements at both the front and back, removing elements from both ends, accessing the front and back elements, and checking the deque's size and emptiness.

- Dynamic Size: Unlike static arrays, DequeImplementation allows the deque to dynamically resize as elements are added or removed, providing flexibility in handling varying queue sizes and efficient memory utilization.

- Efficient Element Insertion and Removal: The implementation employs efficient algorithms for element insertion and removal, ensuring optimal performance when adding or removing elements at either end of the deque.

- Error Handling: DequeImplementation includes error handling mechanisms to handle potential errors, such as deque underflow (when trying to remove elements from an empty deque) or memory allocation failures.

- Customizability and Extendability: The repository provides a foundation for further customization and extension. You can modify the implementation or build upon it to incorporate additional functionalities or tailor it to specific project requirements.

This DequeImplementation repository serves as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing double-ended queues in C++. Whether you're a student studying data structures or a developer seeking to incorporate deque functionality into your projects, DequeImplementation offers a reliable and efficient solution.

Explore the implementation, leverage the power of a double-ended queue, and enhance your understanding of deque operations in C++.
